Space
=====

Space game for the cmd prompt.

You're the `>` ship, which you control by using the up and down arrow keys, and have to dodge the `O` asteroids.

You can shoot  `~`s, that can destroy one asteroid, with the space bar, but be aware that it'll cost 100 points (or however many you have at that point if you have less than 100).
